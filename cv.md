• Modified the renderer to support forward rendering with custom shaders, aligning with a new art style tailored for Meta Quest 3.  
• Integrated OpenXR and Meta-specific extensions, including Fixed Foveated Rendering and Application Space Warp, ensuring smooth performance on mobile VR hardware.  
• Played a key role in overcoming significant technical challenges, with the team navigating constant flux and uncertainty regarding feasibility.

**Creator & Developer: Air Hockey Arcade, Oculus Quest (AppLab) (Oculus Rift, SteamVR & PS VR planned).**

• Prototyped the game in PhyreEngine from my earlier mobile game *Flick Hockey* while at SIE R&D West, showcasing PhyreEngine's VR capabilities alongside our official PS VR sample.  
• Migrated the project to my custom cross-platform VR engine, *Reality Engine*, written in C99:  
• Utilizes OpenGL ES 3.2 on Quest and OpenGL 4.6 on PC.
