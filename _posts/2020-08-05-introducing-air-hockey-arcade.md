**History:**

Back in 2010 I made and self published a little iPhone game called Virtual Air Hockey.  It really didn't do very well and I re-released it as Flick Hockey sometime later via a publisher.  It did marginally better but lets face it, I still didn't make any money from it.

Undetered, when I first heard Sony were creating PlayStation (tm) Mobile and looking for launch titles I contacted SCEE Strategic Content, and they advanced me a small amount of money to convert the game in time for launch.
