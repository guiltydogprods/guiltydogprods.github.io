**History:**

Back between 2009 / 2010 I made and self published a little iPhone game called Virtual Air Hockey.  It didn't really sell very well and I re-released it as Flick Hockey a year later via a publisher.  It did marginally better but lets face it, I still didn't make any money from it.

Undetered, when I first heard Sony were creating PlayStation (tm) Mobile and looking for launch titles I contacted SCEE Strategic Content, and they advanced me a small amount of money to port the game to PlayStation Mobile, which meant a complete rewrite from C, to C# in time for launch. This time it sold much better, it paid back the advance and also made me a little extra before Sony shut down Playstation Mobile.  I spent the next couple of years doing contract work and prototying several other game ideas both on my own and with friends but nothing ever really took off.
