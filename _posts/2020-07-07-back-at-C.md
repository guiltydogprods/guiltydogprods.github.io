For some time now, I've been meaning to revisit coding in C.  I started coding in C while still at college, and stuck with it through University as I preferred it over the at the time new fangled C++.  I was dragged kicking and screaming into the C++ camp while at Sony Studio Liverpool and while I don't hate the language, I had been finding my productivity in personal projects suffering for a while and I suspected it was down to overthinking things when coding in C++.  As has been discussed ad nauseum on GameDev twitter, C++ is an incredibly complex language, there are usually many ways to do the same thing.  Over time, everything had started to become a class with private member variables and setters / getters whether it benefitted from this or not.
